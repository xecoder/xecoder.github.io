				Jobs began attending meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club with Wozniak in 1975<br>
				 In 1976, Wozniak invented the Apple I computer. After Wozniak showed it to Jobs<br>
				  who suggested that they sell it, they and Ronald Wayne formed Apple Computer<br>
				    in the garage of Jobs's Los Altos home on Crist Drive. Wayne stayed only a short time<br>
				    leaving Jobs and Wozniak as the active primary cofounders of the company. <br>
				   A neighbor on Crist Drive recalled Jobs as odd, an individual who would greet his clients <br>
				   "with his underwear hanging out, barefoot and hippie-like." Another neighbor<br>
				    Larry Waterland, who had just finished his PhD at Stanford in chemical engineering<br>
